# Go Library
Reusable go library that mostly implement standardization in the scope of Spotlibs team

Currently, pkg that are already considered has stable API are
- `stderr`: standard interface for any error that may occur in the Spotlibs Team Microservices
- `stdresp`: standard interface to construct standard response
- `validation`: ease validating request for `Goravel` framework
- `debug`: capture stack trace
- `middleware`: consist of some useful and important predefined middlewares
  - `activity monitor`: capture and log all incoming & outgoing http request/response. Can properly record request body with content-type `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` & `multipart/form-data`
  - `metadata header`: set `http.Context` with metadata information coming from the request header
  - `recover`: do recover on panic that occur during processing request in `Goravel` with properly giving back appropriate `stdresp`
